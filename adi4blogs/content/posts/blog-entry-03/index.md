## ~~TIL 01/45~~ Summary (Last 45 days)

Last 45 days have been a roller coaster ride for me. I saw some steep falls, some momentary peaks and had some very helpful realizations. After Semester 4, I had pretty hard time coping up with the shortcomings and result of the semester,I lost my confidence and felt insecure about my career (I still feel that ;_;). Through all this time I felt helpless and drifted away from people. But my family helps me calm down. But one thing I do best is realization, a bit slow but sharp accuracy. 

After realizing the hard way, that one should have a continuous learning-time curve, This summer I explored many tech domains and got a bit clarity about what I can do for next 10 years of my life and it has always been there but yet not so clear that **R&D** is what suits me the best. Reason being that I cant do the same thing everyday but yes I can learn something everyday and do it for some days and then start something new. I never regret (ok maybe 80% no regret) not starting early because mostly I dont feel clueless about what 2 geeks of any other domain talk. Still I wish I was master of some trait, but cool.

When the summer breaks started I was willing to prepare for all the domains (SDE, finance, core, etc) for the campus internship drives to get any backup for next summer as most of them had just one pre requisite basically Competitive Programming. But I am glad I did'nt make that mistake and focussed on finding the domain suitable for me. I spent the vacation learning from MOOCS, building self projects and working on a sponsored research project. I participated in campus internship drive for primarily for core electronics and R&D(in my field of interest). This Summer was definitly better than previous breaks.

I have/had many problems to deal with but i gained a bit confidence in myself and was clear on some fundamentals to move ahead. Seeing people worried about CDC internship drives, some biases/preferences, some not so fair processes caused rift between many people, increased toxicity and through that i was able to see ahead clearly that me or anyone else can't change the process, the world is unfair we have to accept that and move ahead. I sat for some tests and 1 interview each on Day 1 and Day 2. I felt the fear of loosing the day 1 chance at Google Hardware but next day after loosing Google Hardware, I was not so worried on Day 2 and got offer from Texas Instruments. It was a long weekend but I was lucky to make it through. After that I have been looking for projects and research opportunities to work on, but I am out of ideas. I am confused again about what should I learn next ? Should I master core electronics or explore something new ? Becoz this is my last year to learn anything during undergrads (Pre-Final Year Undergrad).

The only thing I learnt from last 2 months is that, the beauty of time is that wether good or bad it passes away...
