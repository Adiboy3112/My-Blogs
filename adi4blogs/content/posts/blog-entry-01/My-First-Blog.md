## Hello Readers, Welcome to Adiboy's Blogs!

#### Why am I starting to write blogs?

I always wanted to write blogs. On many nights when i go to sleep, I feel like sharing about my day with someone or maybe write a diary entry or sometimes share good memmories on social media, but I dont know why, but I dont feel comfortable doing any of that. So yeah, I guess Blogs will work.

#### What to expect from my blogs?

Honestly, **Not very mesmerizing English, Not very motivational stuff, Not very relavent stuff either (atleast most of the times) or Not even very informational stuff either**.
But only some basic understandable writeups and something I wish I could have said to more people than i could.

#### Whats next?

I will try to write blog atleast thrice a week, dump some memories(pics), I do want to stay busy writing blogs so I dont waste time doing random stuff. Well this maybe a big thing to commit but I do want to talk about personal finance, self realization, dump photos and maybe someday write lifestyle blog....... phrrrrwww (the last one is just something i like to say i dont know what the hell is that).

So yeah thats it.
